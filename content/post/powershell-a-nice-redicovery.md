Powershell a nice redicovery



A long time ago I start scripting in windows like in linux but
i felt a bit ill. I miss so many things that I just cannot do it... and
start a Linux VirtualBox on windows.

But eventually I read about powershell improvements, even the objective to be
100% compatible with bash.

And start again the tedious process of studing it.
